Continuing with this serie, The Discord server has only 1 channel where `mcha4ker1337` and `martini-craft` were chatting, checking the messages from the beginning we can see that they played a Chess game :

In the bottom Left we can see martini-craft username on chess.com.

[`https://www.chess.com/member/m4rt1nicraft`](https://www.chess.com/member/m4rt1nicraft) 

Nothing was really interesting there, so we need to take a step back , scrolling down a little bit on Discord , this was interesting `u have some sensitive info exposed on you're profile`

`might want to change that` `ooohhh good catch! I removed it, thanks for the heads up`

`gotta keep my opsec on point!` so right away to the archive, https://web.archive.org/web/20240520023121/https://www.chess.com/member/m4rt1nicraft

Cool we got martiniâ€™s email, I spent some time here trying different tools and tricks to find any info/account related to the email. After a while I came across a great tool :

and we have some progress, we got a link to Google Calendar :

Then it was just straightforward, check the Secret Memorial Day Gamer Event, the Instagram profile https://www.instagram.com/tf4rc_1n1tr4m_733132/ and get the Flag.
