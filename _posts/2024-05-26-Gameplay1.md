When me and my friend aren't duoing CTFs, we like to play video games together. We left a trail of flags in the wake of our gaming antics, can you find them all? Here's a clue to start you off: **mch4cker1337**

Searching **`mch4cker1337`** on google, we came into `Martini Craft` ’s youtube Channel, with a video “Pro Minecraft Gameplay with **mch4cker1337*”*  we can confirm we are on the right path with Flag1 in the description and **mch4cker1337** in the comments. There is nothing in **mch4cker1337**'s channel. Focusing on the video we could see that mch4cker1337 wrote the Flag during the gameplay char by char (That was bad :( ) . Given what we know, with a little a bit of oriented guessing we got the flag without watching the hole video ig hhh.
