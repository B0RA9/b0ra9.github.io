>ðŸ”‘ Rabbit hole: For some reason I came across the Youtube channel and the video in Gameplay-1 before finding the `mch4ker1337` twitter account. This led to a sort of rabbit hole, by finding the steam account `mch4ker1338` and thinking it was the key to the second flag.


Starting from we left Gameplay-1, in the video comments we can see a comment with a link to `martini-craft` â€™s reddit account:

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Feisty-Schedule1097/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWVMbHpMRVptUG1aaHZvdVV6eFVWYUtFZTRwQXxBQ3Jtc0trRWMyRURJWWhvcF80Sm9LQmtyVl9rcFoyeTc3SzVUSUk3dGhRUGtGZklmNW1TQmFLZlNXUVZ4S1NlVWUxUnFGOVVYR2JrYXIxR3lLSThfZGpLRFVhOHAybG55R3l6Y2xDcjNwWHRHZEFjcmVkcUxuZw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fuser%2FFeisty-Schedule1097%2F)

From there we can see that some comments were removed,which may indicate some useful/secret info been hidden. Using reveddit we can restore the removed comments :

One of the comments has a link to a discord server : 

https://discord.gg/962JwKdE

Joining the server we can easily get the second Flag.

>ðŸ”‘ The intended approach seems to be: Finding `mch4ker1337` twitter account â†’Finding his steam account `mch4ker1338` â†’Finding `martini-craft` Youtube channel â†’Flag1 . Then go on with the reddit account to find the second flag.
